Ideal for ending conversations swiftly without appearing rude.", synonyms: [':-)'], origin: "A relic from the primordial soup of online chat rooms, designed for maximal efficiency in minimal character count. A true pioneer in emotional brevity.", examples: ["'Received your 30-page report :)'", "'Thanks for the offer, but I'll decline :)'"] },

It's rarely used for actual unbridled joy, but rather for performative enthusiasm when a simple ':)' just doesn't cut it. Often seen after a moderately funny meme or the promise of free food. The louder sibling of the polite smile.", synonyms: ['xD', 'XD'], origin: "Evolved from the need to digitally overcompensate for genuinely awkward silence in text-based interactions.", examples: ["'Omg that was hilarious :D'", "'Free donuts in the breakroom :D'"] },

Often signifies a joke so exquisitely terrible or an observation so profoundly absurd that mere ':D' cannot contain the digital convulsions. May require a brief recovery period.", synonyms: ['x_D', 'xD'], origin: "Believed to have emerged from early internet forums where users attempted to convey the physical discomfort of extreme laughter through ASCII.", examples: ["'My cat just tried to fight its reflection XD'", "'That GIF is my life XD'"] },
            { emoticon: ';)', definition: "The digital equivalent of an awkward wink. Can mean anything from 'I\'m flirting (badly)' to 'I just made a terribly inappropriate joke that only I understand.'", expandedDefinition: "A highly versatile yet dangerously ambiguous punctuation mark. It suggests shared secrets, subtle sarcasm, or the sender's misguided attempt at charm. Context is not just king; it's the entire monarchy. Use with extreme caution, as misunderstandings often lead to digital tumbleweeds or HR complaints.", synonyms: ['(^_-)'], origin: "The brainchild of a mischievous programmer who enjoyed sowing seeds of confusion in the nascent digital landscape.", examples: ["'I'll 'work late' tonight ;) '", "'Did you see what they wore to the meeting ;) '"] },

Not suitable for actual existential dread.", expandedDefinition: "This simple downturned mouth conveys a superficial sadness. It's the go-to for minor inconveniences like a slow download or a forgotten charger. For truly soul-crushing despair, please consult a therapist, not a series of punctuation marks. A true testament to the trivialization of digital sadness.", synonyms: ['T_T', ';-;'], origin: "Born from the frustration of early modem users, designed to convey a fleeting moment of inconvenience rather than genuine sorrow.", examples: ["'My Wi-Fi is out :('", "'They ran out of my favorite snack :('"] },

Often precedes a frantic scramble.", expandedDefinition: "A wide-eyed gasp of digital astonishment.

High levels of digital adrenaline may follow.", synonyms: ['=O', 'o_O'], origin: "Developed to mimic the universal human expression of immediate, often non-verbal, surprise, suitable for the rapid-fire nature of early instant messaging.", examples: ["'They just announced a surprise audit :O'", "'I accidentally deleted my entire project folder :O'"] },
            { emoticon: 'O_o', definition: "The 'I\'m not confused, you\'re confused' emoticon. Also used when confronted with unexpected stupidity or an inexplicable plot twist in a reality TV show.", expandedDefinition: "This asymmetric gaze suggests a profound level of digital bewilderment. It's the go-to for situations that defy logic, common sense, or basic human decency. Often accompanies a silent 'What just happened?' or 'Are you serious?' when words are simply insufficient to capture the depth of absurdity.", synonyms: ['o.O', '?_?'], origin: "Emerged from the collective exasperation of early internet users trying to comprehend increasingly bizarre online content.", examples: ["'They think the earth is flat O_o'", "'He wore WHAT to the gala? O_o'"] },

Also known as the 'I\'m judging you silently' face, or 'This sounds suspiciously like work.'", expandedDefinition: "This half-frown, half-straight-line conveys a non-committal doubt or mild disapproval. It's the digital equivalent of a raised eyebrow. Often used when someone proposes a questionable idea, or when you're being asked to do something that vaguely resembles effort. A truly versatile expression of digital wariness.", synonyms: ['-_-' , ':-|'], origin: "Created for situations where full enthusiasm was unwarranted, but outright negativity was too much effort.", examples: ["'You want me to work on Saturday :-/?'", "'That sounds... complicated :-/'"] },
            { emoticon: ':P', definition: "The playful tongue poke. Ideal for when you\'ve delivered a mild insult and wish to immediately diffuse the tension by appearing adorably impish. Often fails.", expandedDefinition: "This mischievous emoticon attempts to soften the blow of a teasing remark or a cheeky comment. It's a digital 'just kidding!' but often misfires, leaving the recipient wondering if you're actually being passive-aggressive. Best used among close digital acquaintances.", synonyms: ['=P', ':p'], origin: "A playful offshoot from basic smileys, allowing for a hint of digital sass without resorting to outright rudeness.", examples: ["'You're terrible at this :P'", "'I stole your cookie :P'"] },
            { emoticon: 'xD', definition: "A slightly less intense, yet equally performative, version of 'XD'. For when something is funny, but not 'fall-off-your-chair-and-spill-your-drink' funny.", expandedDefinition: "The 'chuckle' emoticon. It signifies amusement, but not the kind that causes physical incapacitation. Ideal for a decent joke, a clever pun, or when you feel obliged to acknowledge humor without fully committing to grand digital gestures.", synonyms: ['x_d', 'XD'], origin: "A simplified version of 'XD', for when extreme laughter was too much effort to type.", examples: ["'That meme was pretty good xD'", "'You actually fell for that? xD'"] },
            { emoticon: '^_^', definition: "The 'I\'m cute and harmless, please don\'t be angry' emoticon. Frequently used when apologizing for minor infractions or requesting favors.", expandedDefinition: "This demure, cat-like smile is the digital embodiment of innocence.
